# Quantum flow

There are three general types of quantum. Quanta generated by alpha, client quantum requests
(all quanta initialized by clients) and constellation quantum (quanta that are initialized by auditors). All
quanta that are generated by alpha don't have to be wrapped, and two others must be wrapped with 
corresponding quantum wrapper. 

Once the quantum is validated by Alpha, it assigns the apex, timestamp, previous hash, effects proof and 
other quantum specific fields upon execution, before signing and propagating it further to auditors.
An auditor in turn validates quantum alongside with the original request and sends 
an audit result back to Alpha.

When the result majority is reached, Alpha create an envelop containing the result message and 
all auditor signatures. The envelope is delivered back to the client, which verifies the signatures 
and marks the quantum as finalized.

All quanta contracts you can find in [messages](messages.md) documentation.
